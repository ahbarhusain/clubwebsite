                <h1>Rubik's Cube Solver</h1>
                <p>Everyone knows how to scramble a Rubik's cube! But a very few persons are able to solve a cube perfectly. Infact
                    there are many competitions where time contraints play an important role. You have to solev the Rubik's cube
                    under a given time. <br>          
                    With the help of right Algorithms we can solve a Rubik's cube very easily, but here comes the catch, How fast 
                    we can apply the Algorithms???
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here in this project the Machine first make a 3D model of the given cube by taking its picture and solve it using 5 stepper motors.
                    <br>
                    This machine is capable of solving an unbaised Rubik's cube under 5 seconds.

                <h1>CNC Pen Plotter</h1>
                <p>If you are from Engineering Field you might know what a CNC is! Computer Numerically Controlled is used to automatically
                    control machine parts with the help of numeric co-ordinate system, one of the prime example will be 3D Printer. Now we use the concept of 
                    CNC and 3D printer to make a Pen Plotter Machine.
                    <br>
                    This Pen Plotter Machine takes and image makes a Illustrator Sketch out of it and tries to make exact sketch on an A4 Paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cool FACT !!! You can make your AVATAR sketch out of it in 1 or 2 minutes.

                    Most of you might have experienced how frightening as well as fascinating a maze is (mostly in science cities). What makes
                    it more complex is for a Robot to get out the maze. <br> Here in this game you and a RC bot works as a team 
                    where your will be controlling the bot via a bluetooth controller and you task is to help the bot to get out of the maze 
                    in the minimum possible time

                <p>Be The Pied Piper of ANARC !!!</p>
                <p>
                    Have you heard the story of The Pied Piper? Yes! You are right that guys with a flute that drove all the mice out of the city.
                    Basically there is two bot one cat and one mouse. Some cheese will be kept in the field and the mouse has to find and hold it and the role of cat is to prevent the mouse from going towards the cheese.
                    <br>
                    The vision of the event is to show how a cat which is larger in size than the mouse is trying to create obstacles for the mouse as well as how mouse (being small in size ) is trying to overcome those obstacles.
